# Ideas for Applying JEPA to Atari-HEAD Dataset

## Overview

This document explores ideas for applying Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to the Atari-HEAD dataset, which contains human gameplay data including image frames, actions, gaze positions, reaction times, and rewards.

## What is JEPA?

JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) is a self-supervised learning approach that learns representations by predicting one view of data from another view in a latent space, rather than in pixel space. This makes the model focus on learning meaningful representations rather than pixel-perfect reconstructions.

## Potential Applications

### 1. Action Prediction from Game States

**Concept:** Use JEPA to predict human actions from game states.

**Implementation:**
- **Context Encoder:** Process game frames to extract context embeddings
- **Target Encoder:** Process next frames to extract target embeddings
- **Predictor:** Given the context embedding, predict the target embedding
- **Objective:** Minimize distance between predicted embedding and actual embedding of frames associated with specific actions

**Benefits:**
- Learn representations that capture action-relevant features
- Avoid having to predict exact pixel values of next frames
- Focus on modeling the relationship between game state and human decision-making

### 2. Gaze-Informed JEPA

**Concept:** Incorporate human gaze data to enhance JEPA's representation learning.

**Implementation:**
- Use gaze positions to create attention masks for frames
- Create two views: full frame and gaze-attended regions
- Train JEPA to predict representations of gaze-attended regions from full frames
- This helps the model learn what regions humans find relevant for decision-making

### 3. Multi-Modal JEPA for Action-Reward Prediction

**Concept:** Train a JEPA model to jointly learn from image frames, actions, and rewards.

**Implementation:**
- Create embeddings for each modality: frames, actions, scores/rewards
- Train the model to predict action embeddings from frame embeddings
- Simultaneously predict reward embeddings from frame-action pair embeddings
- This creates a representation space that aligns game states with optimal actions and expected rewards

### 4. Temporal JEPA for Game Strategy

**Concept:** Use JEPA to model temporal dependencies in gameplay.

**Implementation:**
- Create context embeddings from sequences of frames
- Predict embeddings for frames several timesteps in the future
- This forces the model to learn representations that capture game dynamics and strategic planning

### 5. Reaction-Time-Weighted JEPA

**Concept:** Use human reaction times to weight the importance of different game states.

**Implementation:**
- Weight training examples by reaction time (longer reaction time could indicate more complex decision states)
- Train JEPA to focus more on states that required longer human deliberation
- This could help the model learn to identify decision points that require deeper planning

### 6. Frame-to-Action Direct JEPA

**Concept:** Directly apply JEPA to predict actions from image frames.

**Implementation:**
- Create a joint embedding space for frames and actions
- Train a context encoder for frames and a target encoder for actions
- Use a predictor to map from frame embeddings to action embeddings
- During inference, find the nearest action embedding to the predicted embedding

### 7. Hierarchical JEPA for Game Understanding

**Concept:** Build a hierarchical JEPA model that captures both short-term and long-term game dynamics.

**Implementation:**
- Low-level JEPA: Learn representations for immediate action prediction
- High-level JEPA: Learn representations for strategic planning and score optimization
- Combine both levels to create a complete game-playing system

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Data Processing
- Extract frames, actions, gaze data, and rewards from the dataset
- Normalize inputs appropriately
- Create train/validation/test splits

### Architecture Design
- Design appropriate encoder architectures for game frames (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformer)
- Design appropriate encoder for actions (e.g., embeddings for discrete actions)
- Design predictor networks that operate in the latent space

### Training Strategy
- Start with simpler games (e.g., Breakout) before moving to more complex ones
- Consider curriculum learning approach, starting with short-term predictions
- Explore contrastive learning objectives alongside JEPA objectives

### Evaluation Metrics
- Action prediction accuracy
- Reward prediction accuracy
- Representation quality measures (e.g., downstream task performance)
- Alignment with human gaze patterns

## Next Steps

1. Select a specific game from the dataset to start with (e.g., Breakout as it's simpler)
2. Implement a basic JEPA model for frame-to-action prediction
3. Evaluate the model's performance against baselines
4. Gradually incorporate more complex ideas (gaze data, temporal aspects, etc.)
5. Scale to more complex games

## Conclusion

The Atari-HEAD dataset provides a unique opportunity to apply JEPA to learn from human gameplay data. By leveraging JEPA's ability to learn meaningful representations without pixel-perfect reconstruction, we can create models that capture the essence of human decision-making in gameplay.
